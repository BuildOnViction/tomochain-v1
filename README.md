## About Tomochain

TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum blockchain. Our mission is to be a leading force in building the Internet of Value, and its infrastructure. We are working to create an alternative, scalable financial system which is more secure, transparent, efficient, inclusive and equitable for everyone.

TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Voting consensus that can support near-zero fee, and 2-second transaction confirmation time. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and "true" randomization processes.

Tomochain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. New scaling techniques such as sharding, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into Tomochain's masternode architecture which will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.

## Tomochain vs Giants

Tomochain is built by the mindset of standing on the giants shoulder. We have learned from all advanced technical design concept of many well-known public blockchains on the market and shaped up the platform with our own ingredients. See below the overall technical comparison table that we try to make clear the position of Tomochain comparing to some popular blockchains at the top-tier.

**we just updated the number of masternodes accepted in the network upto 150*

## Building the source

Tomochain provides client binary called `tomo` for both running a masternode and running a full-node. Building `tomo` requires both a Go (1.7+) and a C compiler. Install them by your own way. Once the dependencies are installed, just run below commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tomochain/tomochain tomochain
$ cd tomochain
$ make tomo
```

Alternatively, you could quickly download pre-complied binary on our [github release page](https://github.com/tomochain/tomochain/releases)

## Running tomo

### Attach to the Tomochain test network

Currently we are publishing our test network 2.0 with full implementation of PoSV consensus at https://stats.testnet.tomochain.com. If you'd like to play ground with creating smart contracts, dapps, you might be interested in give it a try on our test network.

In order to connect to one of the masternodes on the test network, just run this below command:

```bash
$ tomo attach https://testnet.tomochain.com
```

### Run your full node on the Tomochain test network

If you would like to run your own full node and join the Tomochain test network, run these below commands:

```bash
// 1. create a folder to store tomochain data on your machine
$ export DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/data/folder
$ mkdir -p $DATA_DIR/tomo

// 2. download our genesis file
$ export GENESIS_PATH=$DATA_DIR/genesis.json
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomochain/tomochain/master/genesis/testnet.json -o $GENESIS_PATH

// 3. init the chain from genesis
$ tomo init $GENESIS_PATH --datadir $DATA_DIR

// 4. get a test account. Create a new one if you don't have any:
$ export KEYSTORE_DIR=keystore
$ touch $DATA_DIR/password && echo 'your-password' > $DATA_DIR/password
$ tomo account new \
      --datadir $DATA_DIR \
      --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR \
      --password $DATA_DIR/password

// if you already have a test account, import it now
$ tomo  account import ./private_key \
      --datadir $DATA_DIR \
      --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR \
      --password $DATA_DIR/password

// get the account
$ account=$(
  tomo account list --datadir $DATA_DIR  --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR \
  2> /dev/null \
  | head -n 1 \
  | cut -d"{" -f 2 | cut -d"}" -f 1
)

// 5. prepare the bootnode and stats information
$ export BOOTNODES="enode://4d3c2cc0ce7135c1778c6f1cfda623ab44b4b6db55289543d48ecfde7d7111fd420c42174a9f2fea511a04cf6eac4ec69b4456bfaaae0e5bd236107d3172b013@52.221.28.223:30301,enode://298780104303fcdb37a84c5702ebd9ec660971629f68a933fd91f7350c54eea0e294b0857f1fd2e8dba2869fcc36b83e6de553c386cf4ff26f19672955d9f312@13.251.101.216:30301,enode://46dba3a8721c589bede3c134d755eb1a38ae7c5a4c69249b8317c55adc8d46a369f98b06514ecec4b4ff150712085176818d18f59a9e6311a52dbe68cff5b2ae@13.250.94.232:30301"
$ export param="--unlock $account --bootnodes $BOOTNODES --ethstats sun:anna-coal-flee-carrie-zip-hhhh-tarry-laue-felon-rhine@stats.testnet.tomochain.com:443"

// 6. Start up your full node now
$ export NAME=YOUR_FULLNODE_NAME
$ tomo $params \
  --verbosity 4 \
  --datadir $DATA_DIR \
  --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR \
  --identity $NAME \
  --password $DATA_DIR \
  --networkid 89 \
  --port 30303 \
  --rpc \
  --rpccorsdomain "*" \
  --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 \
  --rpcport 8545 \
  --rpcvhosts "*" \
  --ws \
  --wsaddr 0.0.0.0 \
  --wsport 8546 \
  --wsorigins "*" \
  --mine \
  --gasprice "1" \
  --targetgaslimit "420000000"
```

*A bit explain on the flags*

```
--verbosity: log level from 1 to 5. Here we're using 4 for debug messages
--datadir: path to your data directory created above.
--keystore: path to your account's keystore created above.
--identity: your full-node's name.
--password: your account's password.
--networkid: our testnet network ID.
--port: your full-node's listening port (default to 30303)
--rpc, --rpccorsdomain, --rpcaddr, --rpcport, --rpcvhosts: your full-node will accept RPC requests at 8545 TCP.
--ws, --wsaddr, --wsport, --wsorigins: your full-node will accept Websocket requests at 8546 TCP.
--mine: your full-node wants to register to be a candidate for masternode selection.
--gasprice: Minimal gas price to accept for mining a transaction.
--targetgaslimit: Target gas limit sets the artificial target gas floor for the blocks to mine (default: 4712388)
```

### Becoming a masternode
Stay tuned for the guideline how to register a candidate on tomomaster once you get your full-node ready.

### Becoming a masternode in two secs

If you're too lazy to go through all the above commands and annoying flags, we provide some magic scripts to boost you up to run a full-node, register as a candidate for masternode selection and join our network at this repository: https://github.com/tomochain/masternode. Please feel free to give it a try and let us know what you get from there.

## Road map

These following implementation items are eventually dropped into the source code:

- Layer 2 scalability with state sharding
- Asynchronize EVM execution
- Multi-chains interoperable
- Spam filtering
- DEX integration
